# CardGameML
Build a model where two equal deep learning models compete against each other to incrementally learn to play a card game. The card game consist of a deck of cards that is consumed for each game round and variable rounds to be repeated until a final winning score for the match is reached. Then the game is reset and restarted. We will follow the rules of italian game "scopa". Objective is to verify if we can create a model that can learn with no human interaction or training data to play a complex game purely learning it based on rules. The feedbacks to the models and the game stats rules will be returned to the model by a basic "game engine" that evaluates the proposed "move" and returns the new status of the game table and score.
